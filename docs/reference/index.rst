Kepler Mapper
===============

The ``KeplerMapper`` class provides three main functions: ``fit_transform, map, and visualize``. 
These provide the bulk of the functionality for constructing a Mapper graph. 
Cover schemes provide a customizable way of defining a cover for your lens. 
Nerves determine the method that constructs the nodes and edges (or higher order connections).

Visuals
==========

There are many ways to visualize your constructed Mapper. The original and most popular method is to use the ``KeplerMapper.visualize`` function to construct an ``.html`` file. You can then open this file in your browser and explore the result. If you use Jupyter Notebooks, you can visualize the ``.html`` file directly in a notebook using the ``kmapper.jupyter.display`` function. We also provide extensive functionality for constructing Plotly graphs and dashboards using the ``kmapper.plotlyviz`` module.  To learn more about the Plotlyviz functionality, see the `Jupyter demo`_ or `Plotly demo`_.

Adapters
==========

We provide a basic adapter to convert a KeplerMapper graph to `networkx.Graph` format. 

.. note::

  If you would like adapters to other popular formats, please let us know.
