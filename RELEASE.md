## Release log

### 2.0.0

#### Visualization

All of the below changes apply to kmapper's D3 html visualization.

- added searchbar functionality (see documentation for `include_searchbar` in `kmapper.visualize()`)
- upgraded d3 from v3 to v6 -- one huge benefit of the new d3-force library is that it is [deterministic](https://
  twitter.com/mbostock/status/725124754701717504?lang=en), so a given graph will always render the same visually, across browsers and reloads.
- clicking on a node will set it as the "focus node" (the node for which details are shown in the details pane).
  until the user clicks off of the node. That is to say, click-focus is not lost if another node is moused-over.
  Click-focus is released if (1) another node is clicked on, or (2) if the user clicks on the blank canvas.
- hovering over a node will "freeze" it in place until no longer hovering over that node. This makes it easier to
  grab the node.
  If no node is currently set as the "focus node" via a click, then hovering over a node will also make it the focus node.
- once a node is dragged, it stays ("freezes") where it was dragged
- added the ability to freeze (and unfreeze) all nodes with keystrokes f and x,
- the focus node visually "pulses" in the display
- added the ability to "save" the positioning of all nodes in the display. Saves to a .json file.
  Node positioning can be re-loaded via providing the json save file.
- multiple `color_values` arrays can be passed, and switched between interactively in the display.
- the node color function can be specified, as a string, to any function available on the numpy base class (e.g.,
  'mean', 'median', 'max', 'min'. (Before, the only available function was `np.mean`.
    - Multiple node color functions can be specified, and toggled between interactively in the display.
- The toolbar display now uses css flexbox, which avoids overlap-problems on smaller viewports.
